# ShareTrace publications

1. Untitled Master's Thesis (WIP) of [@rtatton](https://github.com/rtatton)
   - Builds upon [2]:
      - Contextualizes ShareTrace as a mobile-crowdsensing application
      - Reformulates the ShareTrace algorithm in an online setting within the formal actor model
      - Proposes an application of local differential privacy to allow centralized population-level risk aggregation
      - Evaluates message reachability, efficiency, and scalability (similar to [2])
      - Evaluates the relationship between message passing, temporal concurrency, and user/contact data distributions
   - [Code implementation](https://github.com/share-trace/akka/tree/main)
